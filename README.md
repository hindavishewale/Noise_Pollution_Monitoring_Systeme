# Noise_Pollution_Monitoring_Systeme
This project uses an ESP8266, KY-036 sound sensor, and 16x2 I2C LCD to monitor noise levels in real time. It classifies sound as LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH and displays results on-screen. Supports offline operation and optional Wi-Fi for cloud monitoring. Ideal for traffic zones, schools, urban, and industrial areas.
